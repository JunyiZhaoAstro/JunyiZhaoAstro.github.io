# Welcome to My Research Website! 

During my undergraduate studies, I worked on a diverse set of research projects‚Äîfrom searching for giant, mysterious emission-line stars to recovering debris-disk parameters with joint modeling though multiple wavelengths. I‚Äôve handled data from facilities including [JWST/NIRCam](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-near-infrared-camera#gsc.tab=0), [ALMA](https://www.almaobservatory.org/en/home/), the [CHARA Array](https://www.chara.gsu.edu/public/tour-overview), [and CTIO‚Äôs Curtis/Schmidt Telescope](https://noirlab.edu/public/programs/ctio/curtis-schmidt-telescope/).

The discovery and characterization of alien worlds have always captivated me: from the structure of gas in protoplanetary disks, to the atmospheric composition of super-Earths, to detecting exoplanets from their faintest signals. I‚Äôm eager to explore entire exosystems across the full electromagnetic spectrum, seeking to understand how multiple components within the alien worlds (host star, gas, planets and their atmospheres) interact and shape each other. To me, probing these distant worlds is not only an exhilarating scientific journey but also a way to understand our place in the cosmos and tackle the biggest questions: Are we alone? How did planetary systems like our own assemble and evolve?

Below are the details of my research projects, if you are interested, please don't hesitate to email me at **junyzhao@umich.edu**.  I would love to chat!

# **Identification and Kinematics of OBe stars in the LMC**
## Advisor: [Sally Oey](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/msoey/)
## 02/2023 - 05/2024


In our research, we tested the traditional approach of identifying OBe star candidates by using HŒ±-continuum subtracted images. Specifically, we compared the candidates detected through this method in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) with known OBe stars listed in an established catalog. To do this, we extracted star-shaped objects from the HŒ±-continuum subtracted images and then evaluated how this group matched up with the cataloged OBe stars in the same region of the LMC. we find that this method results in false positives and is thus insufficient in identifying OBe stars.
We also measure the proper motions of OBe stars within the LMC using data from Gaia DR3. We then combine these findings with the proper motion characteristics of OBe stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) region. We find that the velocity distributions of OBe stars in the LMC and the SMC are very similar. However, the velocity of OBe stars in the LMC is slightly higher than in the SMC. 

### How to find OBe stars
The conventional method of identifying OBe stars results in a high number of false positives because OBe stars are not the only objects that appear on a cont-sub HŒ± image. Other celestial bodies, such as planetary nebulae and red giants, also appear on these images, leading to misidentification. To address this issue, we analyzed the objects across different spectral bands and discovered that OBe stars typically exhibit a bluer g-r index compared to other objects, as indicated in Fig on the right

## Kinematics of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies üåå
### Advisor: [Marla Geha](http://www.astro.yale.edu/mgeha/)
### 05/2024 - 08/2024
Ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) satellite galaxies are believed to have the oldest, most dark-matter dominated, and least chemically evolved stellar populations (Simon 2019). Therefore, UFDs serve as effective cosmological probes for the early Universe and are pristine laboratories for dark matter physics. In this study, we analyze resolved stars of two Milky Way satellite galaxies, Pegasus 3 and Pegasus 4, to provide more precise and accurate measurements of their velocity dispersion, dynamical masses, and mass to light ratios compared to previous studies (Cerny et al. 2023a; Kim et al. 2016). We first select member stars within these two galaxies using radial velocity, proper motion, equivalent width, and color & magnitude measurements. With these selected member stars‚Äô radial velocity measurements, we apply a customized MCMC procedure to fit for their systematic velocity and velocity dispersion, which gives us their dynamical mass estimates (Walker et al. 2006; Wolf et al. 2010; Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013). We reconfirm and conclude these two systems are dark matter dominated dwarf galaxies by comparing them with other similarly faint stellar systems. This work offers us more accurate dynamical mass estimates of Peg 3 & 4 with more spectroscopically selected member stars.

Blue Straggler Stars (BSS) are believed to have originated from binary star interactions. Therefore, modeling binary orbits is crucial for understanding their formation and evolution. In this study, we applied The Joker (a Monte Carlo rejection sampler) to model binary orbits in the WIYN Open Cluster Survey (WOCS). Our objective was to evaluate The Joker‚Äôs efficacy on binaries with ample radial-velocity data (RVD). Exploring the potential usage of The Joker, designed for sparsely measured radial velocities, we applied it to known single-lined binary orbits in M67 and NGC 188. With 70+ binary systems, we compared our Joker orbital parameters among binaries having a diverse array of period-eccentricity combinations (Geller et al. 2021). We found that 5-7 RVD start to meaningfully constrain orbital parameters, and 8-10 RVD are required for unimodal period solutions with eccentricities converging to previous studies‚Äô solutions. Additionally, we explored the possibility of devising observing plans having limited prior measurements with The Joker predicting possible periastron approach times to constrain eccentricity. This work enables us to estimate binary orbital solutions with fewer RVD and to enhance our understanding of the alternative evolutionary tracks of binary systems.

For our future work, we will fit more binary solutions for WD-MS binaries, while improving the pipeline to better suit observation plans and reduce bias our priors might introduce. This study is also used to design future observation plans to break the degeneracies between possible orbits. 

<!---
Through this research experience, I learned about rejection and MCMC sampling. Exposed to time-series radial-velocity data for the first time, I designed a custom pipeline that allows statistical comparison between our results and previous scientific results done by [Aaron M. Geller](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07883). I also become more familiar with using cloud computing and virtual machines.

By analyzing the stellar spatial distribution, we try to search for potential ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies of M31 by examining stellar overdensities within the DELVE survey. We attempt to search for overdensities for horizontal branch (HB) and red giant branch stars (RGB) using Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN). We first focused on Pegasus IV dwarf galaxy and its stellar population as a guide for designing our overdensity search pipeline. With the detected overdensities on the color-magnitude diagram, we also explore the stellar overdensities regarding their spatial distribution.

Ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) satellite galaxies are believed to have the oldest, most dark-matter-dominated, and least chemically evolved stellar populations. Therefore, UFDs serve as effective cosmological probes for the early stage of the Universe. In this study, we applied unsupervised machine learning (DBSCAN & OPTICS) to search for potential UFDs by analyzing spatial overdensities of the tip of red giant branch (TRGB) stars in the DELVE survey.

<!---
After devising the pipeline with DBSCAN, we also tried using HDBSCAN and OPTICS to test which unsupervised machine learning method yielded the best result for the UFD search. Finally, OPTICS is chosen since it recovers several UFDs of M31 with the least number of false positives. During this project, we also explore the star-galaxy separation criteria in the DELVE survey. The tip of the red giant branch selection criteria is modified based on the star-galaxy separation magnitude limit. 
!--->
Our objective is to complement the current catalog of UFDs in the local volume while exploring the potential of using modern statistical density searching tools in UFD studies. We have focused on searching for M31 UFDs and recovered all 10 M31 satellite galaxies in the DELVE DR2 coverage. This work provides tools to identify UFDs in large sky surveys, which helps to test the cosmological constraints of the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (ŒõCDM) model.

<!---
Through this experience, I learned about unsupervised machine learning algorithms by dealing with large survey data. I also have a taste of astrostatistics and designed my own SQL query throughout this project. 
!--->

To further this project, I hope to introduce other types of stars (MS, BSS) into the selection criteria. Also, data from larger areas of the sky will be explored for those ‚Äúmissing satellites‚Äù.
