Summary:On May 6, 2022, I co‑presented “The Night Sky: Constellations, Stars, and Planets” as part of the observational lab for Astro 1 at UC Santa Barbara’s Department of Astronomy. Working alongside Professor Robert Antonucci, I led a short evening lecture beneath the campus sky, guiding students through the identification of major constellations, the lifecycle of prominent stars, and the visible planets. This hands‑on session aimed to deepen learners’ practical understanding of celestial navigation and naked‑eye astronomy.
