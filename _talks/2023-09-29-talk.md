In this talk at the Detrit Observatory, I introduced the Chang’e lunar exploration program, a series of robotic missions undertaken by the China National Space Administration to explore and sample the Moon. The program began in 2007 with Chang’e 1, China’s first spacecraft to travel beyond Earth orbit, which mapped the lunar surface and analyzed its composition before impacting the Moon in 2009. Chang’e 2 followed in 2010, achieving higher‑resolution mapping, testing deep‑space communications at the Earth–Sun L2 point, and even performing an asteroid flyby. In 2013, Chang’e 3 achieved China’s first soft landing on the Moon and deployed the Yutu rover to conduct geological and subsurface studies for nearly 1,000 days. Chang’e 4 made history in 2019 as the first mission to land on the lunar far side, communicating via the Queqiao relay satellite to operate the Yutu 2 rover in the South Pole–Aitken basin.Finally, Chang’e 5, launched in November 2020, collected and returned approximately 1.7 kg of lunar samples from Oceanus Procellarum—World’s first sample‑return mission since the Soviet Luna 24 in 1976. We are back!
