## Abstract:
MWC 758 is a Herbig Ae star surrounded by a protoplanetary disk with a proposed attenuation protoplanet candidate, MWC 758c. We conducted high-contrast imaging observations with JWST/NIRCam in the F200W band, applying four PSF-subtraction techniques: PCA-based angular differential imaging (ADI), PCA with reference angles, roll-subtraction, and reference differential imaging (RDI). None of these methods revealed a companion at the predicted 0.62″ separation. The PCA-ADI contrast curve (PCA = 2) achieves a planet-to-star flux ratio sensitivity of ≲10⁻⁵ at that separation, placing stringent non-detection limits on MWC 758c. Future work will explore additional subtraction parameters and analyze data from the F430 filter. These results refine detection thresholds for embedded protoplanets in transition disks and inform strategies for forthcoming JWST high-contrast campaigns.
