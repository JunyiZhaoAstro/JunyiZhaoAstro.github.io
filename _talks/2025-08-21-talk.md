## Summary

This deck aims to measure the AU Mic debris disk’s vertical scale height h by jointly modeling JWST/NIRCam F444W scattered light and ALMA Band 6 visibilities under a shared geometry (inclination and PA) using a Bayesian MCMC framework (emcee). JWST images are PSF-subtracted with SpaceKLIP/Winnie and forward-modeled with coronagraph transmission and PSF convolution; ALMA is fit in the visibility (u–v) plane with GALARIO. The disk is parameterized as a ring (peak radius 𝜇𝑟, width 𝜎𝑟	​), with an HG scattering phase function (asymmetry 𝑔) for the NIR. Results indicate JWST h ≈0.03 and ALMA h ≈0.02, implying small grains are more vertically extended than mm grains—consistent with stirring by turbulence, stellar winds, or unseen planets. Next steps include testing alternative radial profiles and refining the physical interpretation of the multi-wavelength h difference.
