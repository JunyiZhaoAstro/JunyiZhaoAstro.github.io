## Summary
In this talk at the Detrit Observatory, I traced the evolution of China’s Chang’e lunar exploration program—from its inaugural orbiter Chang’e 1 in 2007, which mapped and analyzed the Moon before impact, to Chang’e 2’s high‑resolution surveys and deep‑space communications tests at L2 in 2010. I highlighted Chang’e 3’s historic 2013 soft landing and Yutu rover deployment, followed by Chang’e 4’s 2019 pioneering far‑side touchdown via the Queqiao relay. We then celebrated Chang’e 5’s November 2020 sample‑return of 1.7 kg from Oceanus Procellarum and culminated with Chang’e 6’s June 2024 mission, which retrieved nearly 2 kg of material from the lunar far side.
