Research and science popularization talks are essential for disseminating findings, soliciting feedback, and fostering collaborations. I am always passionate about presenting. Conferences refine research through peer review and expand networks. Outreach engages diverse audiences and inspires future scientists. Below are my presentations; please email junyzhao@umich.edu with any inquiries.
