Giving research and outreach talks is important for sharing results, getting feedback, and building collaborations. I’ve always enjoyed presenting my work. Conferences help improve research and connect people. Outreach helps share science with the public and inspires future scientists.
Below are my presentations—feel free to email me at junyzhao@umich.edu if you have any questions.
