Research talks are essential for disseminating findings, soliciting feedback, and fostering collaborations. 
I am always eager to present my work. Conferences refine research through peer review and expand networks. Outreach engages diverse audiences and inspires future scientists. 
Below are my presentations; please email junyzhao@umich.edu with any inquiries or concerns.
