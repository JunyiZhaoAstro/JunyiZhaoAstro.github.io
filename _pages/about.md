## About Me

![Frount_page_pic](https://wuhu224.github.io//wuhu224.github.io//images/Frount_Page.jpg){: .align-right width="320px"}

Hello. I am originally from Beijing, the ancient and vibrant capital of China. I began my academic journey at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I studied International Relations before discovering that my true passion lay elsewhere. I subsequently transferred to the University of Michigan to pursue degrees in Astronomy and Earth Science. 

When I am not tackling differential equations or refining Python code, I enjoy feeding campus squirrels, performing chamber music on the violin, and exploring local trails on my touring bicycle.
