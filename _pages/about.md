## About Me

![Running Picture](https://yanbopanpi.github.io/yanbo_pan.github.io//images/marathon.jpg){: .align-right width="320px"}

I am from [Ningbo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningbo), a vibrant coastal city in southeastern China. My academic path began at the University of Wisconsin-Madison 🦡, where I spent my first year studying along the picturesque shores of [Lake Mendota](https://lakeshorepreserve.wisc.edu/visit/places/lake-mendota/). I liked the weather so much that I transferred to the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor ☃️ to complete my undergraduate studies.

Outside of academics and research, I enjoy:
- Distance running 🏃‍♂️
- Playing table tennis 🏓
- Kayaking on the Huron River 🚣‍♂️

When the weather is pleasant, you’ll often find me running through [the Arb](https://mbgna.umich.edu/nichols-arboretum/) after classes. I also love visiting the [State Theatre](https://michtheater.org/) to enjoy movies and shows with friends.
